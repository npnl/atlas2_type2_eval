# Grand Challenges ISLES 2022 Evaluation Container

This repo contains the evaluation container for the ISLES 2022 challenge (e.g. [ATLAS](https://atlas.grand-challenge.org/)). The `build.sh`, `test.sh`, `export.sh` scripts along with most of `Dockerfile` were generated by evalutils version 0.3.1. The code presented here is not needed by participants for the challenge, but it is made available for transparency and to give participants a way to test the evaluations on their own machines.

The image is for evaluating the output of algorithms according to Grand Challenge's expected structure, and is presented here for transparency.
